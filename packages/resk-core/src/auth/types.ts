/**
 * @interface IAuthUser
 * Represents an authenticated user in the application.
 * 
 * The `IAuthUser ` interface defines the structure for an authenticated 
 * user object, which includes an identifier, an optional timestamp 
 * for when the authentication session was created, and an optional 
 * permissions map that specifies the actions the user can perform 
 * on various resources.
 * 
 * ### Properties
 * 
 * - `id` (string | number): A unique identifier for the user. This 
 *   can be either a string or a number, depending on the implementation.
 * 
 * - `authSessionCreatedAt` (number, optional): An optional property 
 *   that stores the timestamp (in milliseconds) of when the 
 *   authentication session was created. This can be useful for 
 *   tracking session duration or expiration.
 * 
 * - `perms` (IAuthPerms , optional): 
 *   An optional property that maps resource names to an array of 
 *   actions that the user is permitted to perform on those resources. 
 *   This allows for fine-grained control over user permissions within 
 *   the application.
 * 
 * ### Example Usage
 * 
 * Here is an example of how the `IAuthUser ` interface can be used:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * const user: IAuthUser  = {
 *     id: "user123",
 *     authSessionCreatedAt: Date.now(),
 *     perms: {
 *         documents: ["read", "create", "update"],
 *         users: ["read", "delete"]
 *     }
 * };
 * 
 * // Function to check if a user has permission to perform an action
 * function hasPermission(user: IAuthUser , resource: IResourceName, action: IResourceActionName): boolean {
 *     return user.perms?.[resource]?.includes(action) ?? false;
 * }
 * 
 * // Example of checking permissions
 * const canReadDocuments = hasPermission(user, "documents", "read"); // true
 * const canDeleteUsers = hasPermission(user, "users", "delete"); // true
 * ```
 * 
 * In this example, the `IAuthUser ` interface is used to define a user 
 * object with an ID, session creation timestamp, and a permissions map. 
 * The `hasPermission` function checks if the user has the specified 
 * permission for a given resource, demonstrating how the `perms` 
 * property can be utilized in permission management.
 * @see {@link IResourceName} for the `IResourceName` type.
 * @see {@link IResourceActionName} for the `IResourceActionName` type.
 * @see {@link IAuthPerms} for the `IAuthPerms` type.

/**
* @interface IAuthSessionStorage
* Interface for managing authentication session storage.
* 
* The `IAuthSessionStorage` interface defines methods for storing and 
* retrieving session data associated with authenticated users. This 
* interface provides a structured way to manage session data, ensuring 
* that it can be easily accessed and manipulated.
* 
* ### Methods
* 
* - `get(key?: string): any`: Retrieves the value of the session 
*   associated with the specified key. If no key is provided, it 
*   returns the entire session value.
* 
*   @param {string} key - The key of the value to retrieve.
*   @returns {any} The value associated with the specified key, or 
*   undefined if the key does not exist.
* 
* - `set(key?: string | IDict, value?: any): any`: Persists a value 
*   in the session storage. This can either be a single key-value 
*   pair or an object containing multiple session data.
* 
*   @param {string | IDict} key - The key of the value to persist, or 
*   an object containing session data.
*   @param {any} value - The value to persist. This can be of any type.
* 
* - `getData(): IDict`: Retrieves all session data associated with 
*   the session name defined in the `sessionName` property.
* 
*   @returns {IDict} An object containing all session data.
* 
* - `getKey(): string`: Returns the key associated with the session 
*   name defined in the `sessionName` property.
* 
*   @returns {string} The session key.
* 
* ### Properties
* 
* - `sessionName` (string, optional): The name of the session used by 
*   the session manager. This can be used to identify the session 
*   context in which the storage operates.

/**
 * @interface IAuthPerm
 * Represents the type associated with the `perm` property, used to evaluate 
 * whether a user has access to a resource.
 * 
 * The `IAuthPerm` type can take on different forms to define permissions 
 * for accessing resources in an application, including a function that returns a boolean,
 * a boolean value, a single resource action tuple, or an array of resource action tuples. This flexibility allows 
 * for both simple string-based permissions and more complex logic 
 * through functions.
 * @template ResourceName - The name of the resource. Defaults to `IResourceName`.
 
 * ### Possible Values:
 * 
 * - **Function**: If `IAuthPerm` is a function, it must return a boolean 
 *   value that determines whether access to the resource should be 
 *   granted to the user. This allows for dynamic permission checks 
 *   based on custom logic.
 * 
 * - **False**: The value `false` indicates that no permission is 
 *   granted for the resource.
 * - **Resource Action Tuple**: A resource action tuple is an array of two elements: the resource name and the action name. This tuple represents a specific action on a resource and can be used to check if a user has permission to perform that action.
 * - **Array of Resource Action Tuples**: An array of resource action tuples allows for checking if a user has permission to perform multiple actions on a resource. This can be useful when you want to check if a user has permission to perform multiple actions on a resource, such as creating, updating, or deleting a resource.
 * - **
 * 
 * ### Example Usage:
 * 
 * Here are some examples of how the `IAuthPerm` type can be used:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * // Example of a dynamic permission check using a function
 * const dynamicPermission: IAuthPerm = (user: IAuthUser) => {
 *     const userRole = getUserRole(user); // Assume this function retrieves the user's role
 *     return userRole === 'admin'; // Grant access if the user is an admin
 * };
 * 
 * // Example of no permission
 * const noPermission: IAuthPerm = false;
 * 
 *  * // Using a single resource action tuple
 * const perm: IAuthPerm = ["users", "read"];
 * 
 * // Using an array of resource action tuples
 * const perm: IAuthPerm = [["users", "read"], ["users", "create"],{"resourceName": "users", "action": "update"}];
 * ```
 * 
 * In these examples, the `IAuthPerm` type is used to define various 
 * permissions for accessing resources, demonstrating its flexibility 
 * and utility in permission management.
 * ```
 * 
 * 
 * @see {@link IResourceName} for the `IResourceName` type.
 * @typedef {((user: IAuthUser) => boolean) | false | IResourceActionTuple<ResourceName> | IResourceActionTuple<ResourceName>[]} IAuthPerm

/**
 * Represents a mapping of authentication permissions for resources.
 * The `IAuthPerms` type defines a structure that maps resource names 
 * to an array of actions that can be performed on those resources. 
 * This type is useful for managing user permissions in an application, 
 * allowing for fine-grained control over what actions users can take 
 * on various resources.
 * 
 * 
 * ### Structure
 * 
 * The `IAuthPerms` type is defined as a `Record` where:
 * - The keys are of type `IResourceName`, representing the names of 
 *   the resources (e.g., "documents", "users").
 * - The values are arrays of `IResourceActionName`, representing the 
 *   actions that can be performed on the corresponding resource (e.g., 
 *   ["read", "create", "update"]).
 * 
 * ### Example Usage
 * 
 * Here is an example of how the `IAuthPerms` type can be used:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * // Example of defining user permissions using IAuthPerms
 * const userPermissions: IAuthPerms = {
 *     documents: ["read", "create", "update"],
 *     users: ["read", "delete"],
 *     posts: ["read", "create"]
 * };
 * ```
 * 
 * In this example, the `IAuthPerms` type is used to define a permissions 
 * object for a user, mapping resources to the actions they are allowed 
 * to perform.
 * @typedef {Partial<{ [ResourceName in IResourceName]: Partial<IResourceActionName<ResourceName>[]> }>} IAuthPerms
 */
