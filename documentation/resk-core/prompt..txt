Oket let's continue right now framework by framework. let's get started with the  @resk/core framework. basicaly, @resk/cores is a framework with a set of utilities or helpers functions. I want you to scan the source folder for @resk/core, and then provide  a complete documentation for that framework. document all availables files or tools in the source folder. Please you can use the documentation folder I've created at the root level of the project to create your own files. inside that folder you can create a subfolder named resk-core. Please write a complete use guide to get started with resk/core and document all availables features.
