/***
This is the main entry point for the application. 
Its purpose is to organize and export various parts of the module, making them available for use in other parts of the application or by other developers who might use this module.

The file doesn't take any inputs or produce any direct outputs. Instead, it acts as a central hub for exporting functionality from other files within the module.

Here's what the code is doing:

It exports a default import named "Session" from a file called "session.ts" in the same directory. This allows users of the module to import Session directly.

It exports all contents of a file or module named "Platform" as a namespace. This means that all exports from the "platform" tools will be accessible under the "Platform" name.

It exports all contents from three separate files: "fields.ts", "resources.ts", and "types.ts". This makes all the exports from these files directly available when someone imports from this module.

The code achieves its purpose by using various export statements. Each line starting with "export" is making something available for use outside of this module. The "* as" syntax in the Platform export creates a namespace, while the other "*" exports make all exports from those files available directly.

There are also two commented-out export lines at the top. These might be exports that were previously used but are currently disabled, possibly for testing or because they're no longer needed.

The main data transformation happening here is the organization of exports. It's taking functionality that's spread across multiple files and centralizing it into a single point of access. This makes it easier for users of the module to import what they need without having to know the exact file structure of the module.

In simple terms, think of this file as a table of contents for a book. It's showing you what's available in the module and where to find it, without containing the actual content itself.
